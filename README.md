# Real-time Object Tracking and Detection System
## Overview
Developed a real-time object recognition and tracking system using OpenCV. The system includes FPS computation, frame saving, and video output functionalities.

## Key Features
### Object Detection: 
Utilized OpenCV for real-time object detection.
### Object Tracking:
Implemented the SORT algorithm for accurate tracking of detected objects.
### FPS Computation:
Calculated frames per second (FPS) to monitor the system's performance.
### Frame Saving:
Added functionality to save specific frames for further analysis.
### Video Output:
Enabled video output to store processed video streams.
## Technologies
Python
OpenCV
SORT Algorithm
NumPy
Matplotlib
Installation
## Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/Pravalka/Object-Detection.git

## Prepare the Environment:
Ensure you have the necessary hardware (camera or video file) for object detection.
Update any configuration settings as required.

## Save Frames and Output Video:
Use provided controls to save frames or output processed video.
## Results
### Real-time Performance: 
Achieved high FPS, ensuring smooth real-time object detection and tracking.
### Visualizations: 
Included visualizations for tracking paths and detection boxes.
